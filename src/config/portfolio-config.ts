    title: "Multivariate Temporal Regression at Scale: A Three-Pillar Framework Combining ML, XAI and NLP",
    journal: "International Conference on Electrical, Computer, and Energy Technologies",
    year: 2025,
    authors: "J.F Kavalakkatt, M.J Darr",
    doi: "",
    abstract: "This paper introduces a novel framework that accelerates the discovery of actionable relationships in high-dimensional temporal data by integrating machine learning (ML), explainable AI (XAI), and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance data quality and streamline workflows. Traditional methods often fail to recognize complex temporal relationships, leading to noisy, redundant, or biased datasets. Our approach combines ML-driven pruning to identify and mitigate low-quality samples, XAI-based interpretability to validate critical feature interactions, and NLP for future contextual validation, reducing the time required to uncover actionable insights by 40â€“60\% . Evaluated on real-world agricultural and synthetic datasets, the framework significantly improves performance metrics (e.g., MSE, $R^2$, MAE) and computational efficiency, with hardware-agnostic scalability across diverse platforms. While long-term real-world impacts (e.g., cost savings, sustainability gains) are pending, this methodology provides an immediate pathway to accelerate data-centric AI in dynamic domains like agriculture and energy, enabling faster iteration cycles for domain experts.",

    doi: "10.1109/ICMLA55696.2022.00125",
    abstract: "We propose a deep learning methodology for multivariable regression based on pattern recognition that triggers fast learning over sensor data. We used a conversion of sensors-to-image, which enables us to take advantage of Computer Vision architectures and training processes. In addition to this data preparation methodology, we explore using state-of-the-art architectures to generate regression outputs to predict agricultural crop continuous yield information. Finally, we compare with some top models reported in MLCAS2021. We found that using a straightforward training process, we were able to accomplish an MAE of 4.394, RMSE of 5.945, and R2 of 0.861.",
